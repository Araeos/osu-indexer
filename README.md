# Osu Indexer
This python program can be used to index the local songs library and check against all ranked songs on [https://osu.ppy.sh] to cleanup the collection.
In this way Osu Indexer finds local songs that are unranked or out of date (via the hash) and furthermore can display any missing ranked songs.
